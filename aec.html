        <h2 class="middleme">Algebuckina Endurance Championship</h2>

        <hr>

        <p>
            The Algebuckina Endurance Series (AEC) has been a long running Sim Racing Esports Series that has gone
            through multiple iterations, but in it’s current form, uses Assetto Corsa. It’s currently free of charge
            with no plan to change this in the future and server infrastructure is provided by Algebuckina Design.
        </p>
        <p>
            For 2025, we will be continuing with GT3 cars just like 2024, but with the upgraded GT3 EVO II cars. Cars
            will be chosen in the reverse of the 2024 championship results with 2 of each car available. If a car is
            already chosen and someone selects the same car, they form a team where it is encouraged that the more
            experienced drivers help out the less experienced with setup and strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            To compress the field’s skill and experience level, every driver is given a compulsory pit time that they
            must serve throughout the race. This means, when a driver pits, they must wait for an allotted time after
            servicing has finished on the car, theoretically it so everyone finishes the race at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            After reading The Rules and Regulations below, you can find our championship sign-ups <a
                href="https://aec.algebuckina-design.au/championship/07bcbc99-cae4-4e4e-9735-fa1ac4cc4a40"
                target="_blank"> here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have signed up, someone will be in contact with you to help get everything setup on your end
            including files to download and the Discord link.

            in their entirety at any time during a race weekend, including between qualifying and the race. If a team

        <h3 class="middleme">Rules and Regulations</h3>

        <hr>

        <h3>Pit Stops</h3>

        <p>Mandatory pit stop times will be returning as they worked in 2024. When service has finished on your car, you
            must wait a designated time before you can set off again. This time is based on the gap to 1st from the
            previous race and has effectively bunched up the field for multiple years now. Endurance races double the
            pit stop time, and everyone gets a flat 5 minutes added to their time to give everyone a half race distance
            break to have a drink etc. Not serving your mandatory pit time may lead to disqualification or a
            readjustment of your finishing position based on the time you did not serve.</p>

        <p>Pit stops limiters are now also in effect, the game will no longer reduce your speed as you enter pit lane,
            you must slow down yourself and use a pit limiter (this can be bound in the content manager controls
            settings). You will receive a pit box lock penalty for 30 seconds if you speed in the pit lane.</p>

        <h3>Race Starts </h3>

        <p>Race starts will be manual rolling starts. The grid will roll out and perform a formation lap, then use their pit limiters to start the race. The rolling start will be staggered, 2 by 2 to try and reduce accidents into the 1st corner. Being in the Discord call is very important for the rolling start as an incident on the formation lap will lead to an aborted start and an extra lap where cars may need to pit to fix their cars and rejoin in their starting position. Any start incidents will be addressed at the end of the race and be punished with a pit time penalty for the next race.</p>

        <h3>Starting Positions</h3>

        <p>Starting positions are based on 2 factors, qualifying and the results of the last race.</p>

        <p>Sprint race days are divided up into 2 races, the 1st has a qualifying session where drivers post the fastest times they can. The fastest car gets 1 point in this session. The race is then a reverse grid based on qualifying. To prevent any gaming of this system, times must be within 105% of the fastest time. If drivers are outside of that time, they must start from the back of the grid from fastest to slowest.</p>

        <p>As for the 2nd race for a sprint day, cars are ordered in a reverse grid from the previous race results.</p>

        <p>This means that the formation lap is used to re-organise cars in their proper grid positions, hence the need to be in the Discord call at this time.</p>

        <h3>Blue Flags</h3>

        <p>Our rules on blue flags differ from most. All cars are outfitted to be able to flash their headlights. If this is done, a car being waved blue flags MUST move over to let them go, though if they do not flash their lights, the car being shown blue flags may fight the overtake. A driver may also request this over Discord instead of flashing their lights, which is also fine. This is to let cars that are fighting for a position pass easily, but let’s cars who aren’t worried about race position the ability to enjoy racing wheel to wheel with someone.</p>

        <p>During Qualifying, a faster car always has right of way. If a car is catching you, you must move to the side to let them past, even if you are on a fast lap. And slipstreaming is strictly prohibited during qualifying to not give teams unfair advantages.</p>

        <h3>Racing Etiquette</h3>

        <p>We have 2 main rules when racing. 1 is to always leave a car room, and 2 is to always avoid being at fault for an accident.</p>

        <p>For rule 1, if you are racing another opponent and you are on the inside OR outside, you must leave room for the other car before, during and after the corner. Once someones front wheel is past the rear wheel of another car, they are considered along side and they now have right of way on that side of the track. You may never force another car off the track or intentionally make contact with them. We want to encourage clean and fun racing between everyone. Failure to do this, depending on the result of the race, can lead to disqualification, time penalties or for intentional bad action, a request to leave the championship. This may seem harsh but we really want a fun racing above all else.</p>

        <p>Rule 2 is for following cars. If you outbreak yourself, it is your job to throw your car off the track to avoid contact with the car ahead. If the contact effects the end of the race, you may be disqualified or given time penalties. If the contact was minor, a driver will receive a 1 place grid penalty for the next race.</p>

        <h3>Incidents between 2 or more drivers</h3>

        <p>If an incident is not covered in the racing etiquette section, the drivers involved in the incident will watch the replay after the race and collectively decide who is at fault and a punishment. If an agreement cannot be reached, another driver not involved and with no bias will make the decision after hearing out both cases. These incidents cannot effect anything retroactively, the finished race is set in stone, but it can effect later races.</p>

        <h3>Corner Cutting</h3>

        <p>This year we will be trailing a corner cutting system that gives a driver 10 warnings before issuing a 30 second time penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage. Also Qualifying laps will be deleted if a driver leaves the track on that lap.</p>

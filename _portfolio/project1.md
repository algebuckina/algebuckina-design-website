## Overview

The Wood Mechanical Keyboard v0.1 delivers the same mechanical keyswitch feel, but with a lower ecological footprint than most other mechanical keyboards. All components (bar key switches) are made in house or sourced locally, with the case, backplate and keycaps being made out of sustainable plywood from plyco. 

The Keyboard can be purchased assembled, unnassembled or a barebones kit that lets you bring your own keyswitchs and keycaps. We also have the option of custom kits with more personable touches, please [contact us](mailto:bradley.t@algebuckina-design.au?subject=Keyboard Custom Kits&body= Hey, %0A I'd like to contact you guys about designing a custom keyboard!) to see what we can do for you.

## Custom Kits

Keycap wood type, style and print\
Keyswitch type and style

Please note, all custom requests come assembled to ensure all components fit together. Also note, due to the complexity of some orders, we may request a design fee BEFORE we start working on your requests.

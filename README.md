# algebuckina-design-website
The old public backup of the code for my past Nodebb based website that cna be viewed here: http://web.archive.org/web/20240206071106/https://algebuckina-design.au/
This html code pairs with the "Custom Pages" Nodebb pugin and places the html and css on pages on the website.

I am in the process of switching to a Jekyll site, which will be at https://algebuckina-design.au/

            ### SWGEmu Mod Manager

            We developed mod manager for SWGEmu, designed to streamline the process of managing and installing mods for
            the game, which users have for years struggled with. Built from the ground up using WinForms, this tool
            provides a user-friendly interface for players to easily manage their mods.

            Key features of the mod manager include the ability to enable, disable, and reorganise mods, as well as
            import new mods to a designated 'mod' folder. The tool also reads and makes changes to the swgemu_live.cfg
            file, and creates a standalone mods.cfg file, ensuring simple integration with the game.

            In addition to mod management, the tool also functions as a SWGEmu Launcher, providing a convenient and
            centralised way for players to launch the game with their desired mods and settings. By simplifying the
            process of mod management, this tool aims to enhance the overall gaming experience for SWGEmu players.

            You can have a look at it [here](https://github.com/algebuckina/mtg-mod-manager).


            ### Saint Matthew's Uniting Church Livestreaming Solution

            We undertook a project to elevate the Church's livestreaming capabilities, providing a high-quality,
            broadcast experience for the community. The project involved multiple mini projects, including cameras,
            software, hardware and sound.

            To achieve this, we installed a three-camera setup, allowing for a more versatile and engaging visual
            experience. This was complemented by the design, build, and installation of a custom multimedia desk, which
            served as the central hub for the Church's streaming operations.

            The multimedia desk was integrated with OBS (Open Broadcasting Software) and a stream deck, enabling
            comprehensive control over the entire service. This setup allowed for switching between cameras, management
            of audio levels, and real-time monitoring of the stream, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted experience for
            the online congregation.

            The project's impact was particularly significant during the Covid lockdowns in Sydney, as it enabled the
            Church to maintain a strong sense of community and connection with its members, even when in-person
            attendance was not possible. The new streaming setup allowed the Church to reach a wider audience, providing
            a vital lifeline for those who were unable to attend services in person. The success of the project has had
            a lasting impact, with the Church continuing to stream two out of three services on Twitch and editing and
            uploading these services to YouTube a few days later.

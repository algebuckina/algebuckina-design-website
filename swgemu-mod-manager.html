    <h2>SWGEmu Mod Manager</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>A bit about SWGEmu <br> Star Wars Galaxies is a massively multi-player online role playing game introduced by Sony Online Entertainment in the year 2003. It is the game this project focuses to recreate at a specific milestone referred to as Pre-CU, or Pre-Combat Upgrade. The Combat Upgrade was a set of game changes which radically changed the game-play, to the dislike of thousands of players. These changes led to the founding of the project, in an attempt to "recreate" the game as it was during the Pre-CU era.
        At SWGEmu, Emulator refers to the software the SWGEmu team is building. The Emulator is meant to imitate Sony Online Entertainment's server-side software, which hosted the galaxies of Star Wars Galaxies during the Pre-CU era.</p>
    <p>Why I made a Mod Manager <br> I've been playing Star Wars Galaxies Emulator since 2015 and have always loved installing mods and chainging what the game looks like, even to the point of <a href="https://modthegalaxy.com/index.php?resources/&creator_id=5766" target="_blank">my own mods.</a> But when it came to removing mods, it was always really cumbersome and you'd end up breaking other mods when trying to remove stuff. After toying with the idea for years (and getting pestered by people about it), I finally bit the bullet and wrote my own mod manager to easily handle installing, removing and reordering mods. <br> -Bradley</p>

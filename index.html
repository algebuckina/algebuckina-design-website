            # About Us

            Algebuckina Design is a small design and manufacturing company in Western Sydney Australia. It is owned and
            run by Bradley Turner, an Industrial Design graduate who is currently working a 2nd job in packaging design.
            At Algebuckina Design, our aim is to make common household electronic peripherals more open and
            environmentally friendly and reduce the amount of plastic used in their construction.

            ### What we are working on

            We are currently in the process of developing 2 products. The 1st is a wood keyboard that aims to reduce the
            amount of plastics used in modern keyboards, while maintaining a premium typing feel. And the other is an
            open source car head unit to keep older cars up to date on technology and reduce the need to upgrade, and to
            remove the lock in ecosystem cars and aftermarket head units currently employ.

            ### What we offer

            We also offer 2 services. Firstly we are equipped to make custom VR environments for customers. Including
            custom 3D Models of products and the ability to recreate interior spaces. Secondly we offer a simple custom
            website just like this one. It is based on Nodebb, which is a free open source forum service, and we utilise
            plug-ins to create a custom website on top of it.

            If you're interested in any of these products or services, feel free to contact us.
